# FitBit Fitness Tracker Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of FitBit Fitness Tracker App data. The dataset used in this project was generated through a distributed survey conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to submit personal tracker data, providing minute-level outputs for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset is diverse, comprising 18 different files such as dailyActivity, dailyCalories, hourlySteps, and more.
